# WG Resource Management

A working group that is a cross-team effort sponsored by sig-node and sig-scheduling with
a focus on improving Kubernetes resource management.

Many advanced resource management topics span these two functional areas, and this working
group is intended to support collaboration.  Prior to pursuing major changes in resource
management, it is encouraged that community members share their ideas in this working group
to reach broad consensus across the sigs.  Once consensus is reached, the enhancements
are then managed by the appropriate sig based on impacted areas of code.

It is an open and active working group, and we always welcome new additions!

## Goals:

Topics include, but are not limited to:

* performance sensitive pods (exclusive cores, cpu pinning strategies, numa)
* integrating new devices (gpus, fpga, etc.)
* isolation of new resources (hugepages, caches, etc.)
* enhancements to quality of service
* ...

Basically, any topic that may span [sig-node](../sig-node) and [sig-scheduling](../sig-scheduling).

## Contact us:

At this time, the group discussion primarily occurs on sig-node slack channel.
